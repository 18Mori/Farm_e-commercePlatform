# AgriConnect - Your Farm Partner

Welcome to AgriConnect, a holistic farm management and predictive analytics platform built to empower modern farmers!

---

## Project Overview

**AgriConnect** is designed to be a centralized and intelligent hub for farmers, like Elias Mwangangi(a created persona), to manage all aspects of their agricultural activities. While it includes a marketplace for farm products (tools, feeds, produce, livestock), its mission is much broader: optimize yields, reduce costs, and mitigate risks for both crop and livestock farmers through actionable insights and smart automation.

- **Weather & Climate Resilience Module:** Hyper-local, real-time weather forecasts, extreme weather alerts, and strategic advice for crop/livestock protection.
- **Market Price & Demand Forecasting:** Real-time market prices and predictive analytics for optimal selling times and diversification.
- **Farm Resource Management:** Track inventory of seeds, fertilizer, feed, and medicine with usage analytics and reorder reminders.
- **Smart Crop Monitoring & Health Diagnosis:** Upload plant photos for AI-powered pest/disease/nutrient diagnosis with remedy suggestions.

#### Weather Data Setup

- **To enable live weather features:**
  1. Register for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api).
  2. Open `script.js` and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.
  3. Note: New API keys may take a few minutes to activate.

## Usage Notes

- Many features (login/signup, product uploads, farm data saving, AI diagnosis, real-time markets) are **conceptual** in this version.
- The JavaScript/jQuery code includes AJAX calls for these features, but they **require a backend server and database** to be functional.
- Without a backend, you can still browse the UI, view weather (with API key), and explore the design and code.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Markup for structure and content.
- **CSS3:** Responsive layouts and styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Client-side interactivity, DOM manipulation, and validation.
- **jQuery:** Simplifies DOM traversal, event handling, and AJAX.
- **AJAX:** Asynchronous data fetching (weather API, conceptual backend).
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Real-time weather data integration.
