## ☀️ How to Enable Live Weather

1. **Get a Free API Key:** Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) for your weather data key.
2. **Set Your Key:** In the `script.js` file, replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your new API key.
3. **Wait a Few Minutes:** New keys may take a short while to activate.

*Now you’ll always know if you need an umbrella or an extra layer for your cows!*

## 💡 Usage Notes

- Many advanced features (login, product uploads, AI diagnosis, data saving) are **conceptual** in this version.
- The code includes JavaScript & jQuery for dynamic actions and AJAX calls, but you’ll need to connect a backend server and database to unlock full functionality.
- Without a backend, you can still enjoy exploring the UI, checking real-time weather (with your API key), and seeing how everything fits together.
